   “Holy Ghost,” Topics and Questions (2023)

   Overview

Holy Ghost

   The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead. He is a personage of
   spirit, without a body of flesh and bones. He is often referred to as
   the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord,
   or the Comforter.

Roles of the Holy Ghost

   The Holy Ghost works in perfect unity with Heavenly Father and Jesus
   Christ, fulfilling several roles to help us live righteously and
   receive the blessings of the gospel.

   He “witnesses of the Father and the Son”^1 and reveals and teaches “the
   truth of all things.”^2 We can receive a sure testimony of Heavenly
   Father and Jesus Christ only by the power of the Holy Ghost. His
   communication to our spirit carries far more certainty than any
   communication we can receive through our natural senses.

   As we strive to stay on the path that leads to eternal life, the Holy
   Ghost can guide us in our decisions and protect us from physical and
   spiritual danger.

   Through Him, we can receive gifts of the Spirit for our benefit and for
   the benefit of those we love and serve.^3 He is the Comforter.^4 As the
   soothing voice of a loving parent can quiet a crying child, the
   whisperings of the Spirit can calm our fears, hush the nagging worries
   of our life, and comfort us when we grieve. The Holy Ghost can fill us
   “with hope and perfect love”^5 and “teach [us] the peaceable things of
   the kingdom.”^6

   Through His power, we are sanctified as we repent, receive the
   ordinances of baptism and confirmation, and remain true to our
   covenants.^7

   He is the Holy Spirit of Promise.^8 In this capacity, He confirms that
   the priesthood ordinances we have received and the covenants we have
   made are acceptable to God. This approval depends on our continued
   faithfulness.

The Gift of the Holy Ghost

   All honest seekers of the truth can feel the influence of the Holy
   Ghost, leading them to Jesus Christ and His gospel. However, the
   fulness of the blessings given through the Holy Ghost are available
   only to those who receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and remain worthy.

   After a person is baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of
   Latter-day Saints, one or more Melchizedek Priesthood holders lay their
   hands on the person’s head and, in a sacred priesthood ordinance,
   confirm him or her a member of the Church. As part of this ordinance,
   called confirmation, the person is given the gift of the Holy Ghost.

   The gift of the Holy Ghost is different from the influence of the Holy
   Ghost. Before baptism, a person can feel the influence of the Holy
   Ghost from time to time and through that influence can receive a
   testimony of the truth. After receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, a
   person has the right to the constant companionship of that member of
   the Godhead if he or she keeps the commandments.
